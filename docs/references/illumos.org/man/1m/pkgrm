NAME

   pkgrm - remove a package from the system

SYNOPSIS

   pkgrm [-nv] [-a admin] [ [-A | -M] -R root_path]
   [-V fs_file]
   [pkginst... | -Y category[,category...]]
   pkgrm -s spool
   [pkginst... | -Y category[,category...]]

DESCRIPTION

   pkgrm will remove a previously installed or partially installed package
   from the system. A check is made to determine if any other packages
   depend on the one being removed. If a dependency exists, the action
   taken
   is defined in the admin file.
   The default state for the command is in interactive mode, meaning that
   prompt messages are given during processing to allow the administrator
   to
   confirm the actions being taken. Non-interactive mode can be requested
   with the -n option.
   The -s option can be used to specify the directory from which spooled
   packages should be removed.
   Certain unbundled and third-party packages are no longer entirely
   compatible with the latest version of pkgrm. These packages require
   user
   interaction throughout the removal and not just at the very beginning.
   To remove these older packages (released prior to Solaris 2.4), set the
   following environment variable:NONABI_SCRIPTS=TRUE pkgrm permits
   keyboard
   interaction throughout the removal as long as this environment variable
   is set.

OPTIONS

   The following options are supported:
   -a admin
   Use the installation administration file, admin, in place of the
   default admin file. pkgrm first looks in the current working
   directory for the administration file. If the specified
   administration file is not in the current working directory, pkgrm
   looks in the /var/sadm/install/admin directory for the administration
   file.
   -A
   Remove the package files from the client's file system, absolutely.
   If a file is shared with other packages, the default behavior is to
   not remove the file from the client's file system.
   -M
   Instruct pkgrm not to use the $root_path/etc/vfstab file for
   determining the client's mount points. This option assumes the mount
   points are correct on the server and it behaves consistently with
   Solaris 2.5 and earlier releases.
   -n
   Non-interactive mode. If there is a need for interaction, the command
   will exit.
   Use of this option requires that at least one package instance be
   named upon invocation of the command. Certain conditions must exist
   for a package to be removed non-interactively or a non-restrictive
   admin file needs to be used.
   -R root_path
   Defines the full path name of a directory to use as the root_path.
   All files, including package system information files, are relocated
   to a directory tree starting in the specified root_path.
   Note -
   The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced
   with the -R option. Doing so might damage the global zone's file
   system, might compromise the security of the global zone, and might
   damage the non-global zone's file system. See [1]zones(5).
   -s spool
   Remove the specified package(s) from the directory spool. The default
   directory for spooled packages is /var/sadm/pkg.
   -v
   Trace all of the scripts that get executed by pkgrm, located in the
   pkginst/install directory. This option is used for debugging the
   procedural and non-procedural scripts.
   -V fs_file
   Specify an alternative fs_file to map the client's file systems. Used
   in situations where the $root_path/etc/vfstab file is non-existent or
   unreliable.
   -Y category
   Remove packages based on the value of the CATEGORY parameter stored
   in the installed or spooled package's [2]pkginfo(4) file. No package
   with the CATEGORY value of system can removed from the file system
   with this option.

OPERANDS

   The following operand is supported:
   pkginst
   Specifies the package to be removed. The format pkginst.* can be used
   to remove all instances of a package.
   The asterisk character (*) is a special character to some shells and
   may need to be escaped. In the C-Shell, "*" must be surrounded by
   single quotes (') or preceded by a backslash (\).

EXAMPLES

Example 1: Removing All Instances of SUNWjunk from client1

   The following example removes all instances of SUNWjunk from client1:
   example% pkgrm -R /export/root/client1 SUNWjunk*
   Note the caveat on the use of the -R option in the description of that
   option, above.

EXIT STATUS

   The following exit values are returned:
   0
   Successful completion.
   1
   Fatal error.
   2
   Warning.
   3
   Interruption.
   4
   Administration.
   10
   Reboot after removal of all packages.
   20
   Reboot after removal of this package.

NOTES

   Package commands are [17]largefile(5)-aware. They handle files larger
   than 2
   GB in the same way they handle smaller files. In their current
   implementations, [18]pkgadd(1M), [19]pkgtrans(1) and other package
   commands can
   process a datastream of up to 4 GB.
