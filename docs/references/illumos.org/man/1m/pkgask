   PKGASK(1M) Maintenance Commands PKGASK(1M)

NAME

   pkgask - stores answers to a request script

SYNOPSIS

   pkgask [-d device] [-R root_path] -r response pkginst...

DESCRIPTION

   pkgask allows the administrator to store answers to an interactive
   package (one with a request script, that is, a user-created file that
   must be named request). Invoking this command generates a response file
   that is then used as input at installation time. The use of this
   response
   file prevents any interaction from occurring during installation since
   the file already contains all of the information the package needs.

OPTIONS

   The following options are supported
   -d device
   Run the request script for a package on device. device
   can be a directory pathname or the identifiers for tape,
   floppy disk or removable disk (for example, /var/tmp,
   /dev/diskette, and /dev/dsk/c1d0s0). The default device
   is the installation spool directory.
   -R root_path
   Define the full path name of a directory to use as the
   root_path. All files, including package system
   information files, are relocated to a directory tree
   starting in the specified root_path.
   Note -
   The root file system of any non-global zones must not
   be referenced with the -R option. Doing so might damage
   the global zone's file system, might compromise the
   security of the global zone, and might damage the non-
   global zone's file system. See [1]zones(5).
   -r response
   Identify a file or directory which should be created to
   contain the responses to interaction with the package.
   The name must be a full pathname. The file, or directory
   of files, can later be used as input to the [2]pkgadd(1M)
   command.

OPERANDS

   The following operands are supported:
   pkginst
   Specify the package instance, or list of instances for which
   request scripts will be created. The token all may be used to
   refer to all packages available on the source medium.

EXIT STATUS

   0
   Successful completion.
   >0
   An error occurred.

NOTES

   The -r option can be used to indicate a directory name as well as a
   filename. The directory name is used to create numerous response files,
   each sharing the name of the package with which it should be
   associated.
   This would be used, for example, when you will be adding multiple
   interactive packages with one invocation of [15]pkgadd(1M). Each
   package
   would need a response file. To create multiple response files with the
   same name as the package instance, name the directory in which the
   files
   should be created and supply multiple instance names with the pkgask
   command. When installing the packages, you will be able to identify
   this
   directory to the [16]pkgadd(1M) command.
   If the default admin file is too restrictive, the administration file
   may
   need to be modified to allow for total non-interaction during a package
   installation. See [17]admin(4) for details.
