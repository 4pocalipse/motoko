   PKGADM(1M) Maintenance Commands PKGADM(1M)

NAME

   pkgadm - manage packaging system

SYNOPSIS

   pkgadm dbstatus [-R rootpath]
   pkgadm sync [-R rootpath] [-q]
   pkgadm -V
   pkgadm -?

DESCRIPTION

   The pkgadm utility is used for managing the packaging system. It has
   several subcommands that perform various operations relating to
   packaging.
   sync
   Writes the contents file and rolls the contents log file. With use of
   the -q option, forces the contents file server to quit.

Internal Install Database

   The Solaris operating system relies upon enhanced System V revision 4
   (SVr4) packages as the basis for its software installation and revision
   management. The package maintenance software stores information about
   installed packages in an internal database. The pkgadm subcommand
   dbstatus is used to determine how the package internal database is
   implemented. The dbstatus command returns a string that indicates the
   type of internal database in use. In the current implementation, the
   dbstatus command always returns the string text, which indicates that
   the
   [1]contents(4) package database is in use. Future releases of Solaris
   might
   supply alternative database implementations.

OPTIONS

   The following options are supported:
   -q
   (Applies to sync subcommand.) Shuts down the contents file cache
   daemon.
   -R rootpath
   Defines the full name of a directory to use as the root (/) path.
   Note -
   The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced
   with the -R option. Doing so might damage the global zone's file
   system, might compromise the security of the global zone, and might
   damage the non-global zone's file system. See [2]zones(5).
   -V
   Print version associated with packaging tools.
   -?
   Print help message.

EXAMPLES

Example 1: Synchronizing the contents file

   The following example forces any pending changes to the [3]contents(4)
   file
   to be flushed and the pkgserv daemon to shut down.
   example% pkgadm sync -q

EXIT STATUS

   0

   non-zero
