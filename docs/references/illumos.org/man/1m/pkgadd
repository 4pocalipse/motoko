   PKGADD(1M) Maintenance Commands PKGADD(1M)

NAME

   pkgadd - transfer software packages to the system

SYNOPSIS

   pkgadd [-nv] [-a admin] [-G] [ [-M] -R root_path]
   [-r response] [-V fs_file]
   [-d device | -d datastream pkginst | all]
   [pkginst | -Y category [, category]...]
   pkgadd -s [-d device | -d datastream pkginst | all]
   [pkginst | -Y category [, category]...]

DESCRIPTION

   pkgadd transfers the contents of a software package from the
   distribution
   medium or directory to install it onto the system. Used without the -d
   device source specifier, pkgadd looks in the default spool directory
   (/var/spool/pkg) for the package. Used with the -s option, it writes
   the
   package to a spool directory instead of installing it.
   The pkgadd utility requires an amount of temporary space the size of
   the
   package that is being installed. pkgadd determines which temporary
   directory to use by checking for the existence of the $TMPDIR
   environment
   variable. If $TMPDIR is not defined, pkgadd uses P_tmpdir from stdio.h.
   P_tmpdir has a default of /var/tmp/.
   Certain unbundled and third-party packages are no longer entirely
   compatible with the latest version of pkgadd. These packages require
   user
   interaction throughout the installation and not just at the very
   beginning, or require that their request scripts be run as the root
   user.
   To install these older packages (released prior to Solaris 2.4), set
   the
   following environment variable: NONABI_SCRIPTS=TRUE
   As long as this environment variable is set, pkgadd permits keyboard
   interaction throughout the installation and package request scripts are
   run as root.
   If you have package request scripts that require running as user root
   (instead of noaccess [the default] or user install), use the
   rscript_alt
   parameter in the [1]admin(4) file to make an appropriate selection. See
   [2]admin(4).
   Note that, in Solaris 8 and Solaris 9, the default user when running a
   request script was either root or nobody, depending on the operating
   system's patch level. In the current release, the default user is
   noaccess.
   When running pkgadd in the global zone (see [3]zones(5)), a package
   that
   contains a request script (see [4]pkgask(1M)) is added only to the
   global
   zone. The package is not propagated to any current or
   yet-to-be-installed
   non-global zone. This behavior mimics the effect of the -G option,
   described below.
   Package commands are [5]largefile(5)-aware. They handle files larger
   than 2
   GB in the same way they handle smaller files. In their current
   implementations, pkgadd, [6]pkgtrans(1) and other package commands can
   process a datastream of up to 4 GB.
   The -d, -Y, and pkginst arguments shown in the SYNOPSIS are described
   under OPERANDS, following OPTIONS.

OPTIONS

   The supported options are described as follows. The -d device source
   specifier is described under OPERANDS, below.
   -a admin
   Define an installation administration file, admin, to be used in
   place of the default administration file. The token none overrides
   the use of any admin file, and thus forces interaction with the user.
   Unless a full path name is given, pkgadd first looks in the current
   working directory for the administration file. If the specified
   administration file is not in the current working directory, pkgadd
   looks in the /var/sadm/install/admin directory for the administration
   file.
   -G
   Add package(s) in the current zone only. When used in the global
   zone, the package is added to the global zone only and is not
   propagated to any existing or yet-to-be-created non-global zone. When
   used in a non-global zone, the package(s) are added to the non-global
   zone only.
   This option causes package installation to fail if, in the pkginfo
   file for a package, SUNW_PKG_ALLZONES is set to true. See
   [7]pkginfo(4).
   -M
   Instruct pkgadd not to use the $root_path/etc/vfstab file for
   determining the client's mount points. This option assumes the mount
   points are correct on the server and it behaves consistently with
   Solaris 2.5 and earlier releases.
   -n
   Installation occurs in non-interactive mode. Suppress output of the
   list of installed files. The default mode is interactive.
   -r response
   Identify a file or directory which contains output from a previous
   [8]pkgask(1M) session. This file supplies the interaction responses
   that
   would be requested by the package in interactive mode. response must
   be a full pathname.
   -R root_path
   Define the full path name of a directory to use as the root_path. All
   files, including package system information files, are relocated to a
   directory tree starting in the specified root_path. The root_path may
   be specified when installing to a client from a server (for example,
   /export/root/client1).
   Note -
   The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced
   with the -R option. Doing so might damage the global zone's file
   system, might compromise the security of the global zone, and might
   damage the non-global zone's file system. See [9]zones(5).
   -s spool
   Write the package into the directory spool instead of installing it.
   -v
   Trace all of the scripts that get executed by pkgadd, located in the
   pkginst/install directory. This option is used for debugging the
   procedural and non-procedural scripts.
   -V fs_file
   Specify an alternative fs_file to map the client's file systems. For
   example, used in situations where the $root_path/etc/vfstab file is
   non-existent or unreliable.
   When executed without options or operands, pkgadd uses /var/spool/pkg
   (the default spool directory).

OPERANDS

   The following operands are supported:

Sources

   By default, pkgadd looks in the /var/spool/pkg directory when searching
   for instances of a package to install or spool. Optionally, the source
   for the package instances to be installed or spooled can be specified
   using:
   -d device
   -d datastream pkgname,... | all
   Install or copy a package from device. device can be any of the
   following:
   o A full path name to a directory or the identifiers for
   tape, floppy disk, or removable disk (for example,
   /var/tmp or /floppy/floppy_name).
   o A device alias (for example, /floppy/floppy0).
   o A datastream created by pkgtrans (see [10]pkgtrans(1)).
   The second form of the -d specifier, above, indicates the syntax you
   use when specifying a datastream. In this case you must specify
   either a comma-separated list of package names or the keyword all.

Instances

   By default, pkgadd searches the specified source, and presents an
   interactive menu allowing the user to select which package instances
   found on the source are to be installed. As an alternative, the package
   instances to be installed can be specified using:
   pkginst
   The package instance or list of instances to be installed. The token
   all may be used to refer to all packages available on the source
   medium. The format pkginst.* can be used to indicate all instances of
   a package.
   The asterisk character (*) is a special character to some shells and
   may need to be escaped. In the C-Shell, the asterisk must be
   surrounded by single quotes (') or preceded by a backslash (\).
   -Y category[,category...]
   Install packages based on the value of the CATEGORY parameter stored
   in the package's [11]pkginfo(4) file. All packages on the source medium
   whose CATEGORY matches one of the specified categories will be
   selected for installation or spooling.

EXAMPLES

Example 1: Installing a Package from a Solaris DVD

   The following example installs a package from a Solaris DVD. You are
   prompted for the name of the package you want to install.
   example# pkgadd -d /cdrom/cdrom0/s0/Solaris_10/Product

Example 2: Installing a Set of Packages from a Datastream

   The example command shown below installs all of the packages in the
   datastream specified by the -d source specifier. Prior to this command,
   this datastream must have been created with the [12]pkgtrans(1)
   command.
   example# pkgadd -d /var/tmp/datastream all
   The keyword all specifies that all of the packages found in the
   designated datastream will be installed.

EXIT STATUS

   0
   Successful completion
   1
   Fatal error.
   2
   Warning.
   3
   Interruption.
   4
   Administration.
   5
   Administration. Interaction is required. Do not use pkgadd -n.
   10
   Reboot after installation of all packages.

NOTES

   When transferring a package to a spool directory, the -r, -n, and -a
   options cannot be used.
   The -r option can be used to indicate a directory name as well as a
   filename. The directory can contain numerous response files, each
   sharing
   the name of the package with which it should be associated. This would
   be
   used, for example, when adding multiple interactive packages with one
   invocation of pkgadd. In this situation, each package would need a
   response file. If you create response files with the same name as the
   package (for example, pkinst1 and pkinst2), then name the directory in
   which these files reside after the -r.
   The -n option causes the installation to halt if any interaction is
   needed to complete it.
   If the default admin file is too restrictive, the administration file
   may
   need to be modified to allow for total non-interaction during a package
   installation. See [30]admin(4) for details.
