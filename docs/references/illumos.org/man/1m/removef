   REMOVEF(1M) Maintenance Commands REMOVEF(1M)

NAME

   removef - remove a file from software database

SYNOPSIS

   removef [ [-M] -R root_path] [-V fs_file] pkginst path...
   removef [ [-M] -R root_path] [-V fs_file] -f pkginst

DESCRIPTION

   removef informs the system that the user, or software, intends to
   remove
   a pathname. Output from removef is the list of input pathnames that may
   be safely removed (no other packages have a dependency on them).

OPTIONS

   The following options are supported:
   -f
   After all files have been processed, removef should be invoked with
   the -f option to indicate that the removal phase is complete.
   -M
   Instruct removef not to use the $root_path/etc/vfstab file for
   determining the client's mount points. This option assumes the mount
   points are correct on the server and it behaves consistently with
   Solaris 2.5 and earlier releases.
   -R root_path
   Define the full path name of a directory to use as the root_path. All
   files, including package system information files, are relocated to a
   directory tree starting in the specified root_path. The root_path may
   be specified when installing to a client from a server (for example,
   /export/root/client1).
   removef inherits the value of the PKG_INSTALL_ROOT environment
   variable. (See ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES, below.) If PKG_INSTALL_ROOT is
   set, such as when the -R option is used with [1]pkgadd(1M) or
   [2]pkgrm(1M),
   there is no need to use the removef -R option.
   Note -
   The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced
   with the -R option. Doing so might damage the global zone's file
   system, might compromise the security of the global zone, and might
   damage the non-global zone's file system. See [3]zones(5).
   -V fs_file
   Specify an alternative fs_file to map the client's file systems. For
   example, used in situations where the $root_path/etc/vfstab file is
   non-existent or unreliable.

OPERANDS

   The following operands are supported:
   path
   The pathname to be removed.
   pkginst
   The package instance from which the pathname is being removed.

EXAMPLES

Example 1: Using removef

   The following example uses the removef command in an optional
   pre-install
   script:
   echo "The following files are no longer part of this package
   and are being removed."
   removef $PKGINST /myapp/file1 /myapp/file2 |
   while read pathname
   do
   echo "$pathname"
   rm -f $pathname
   done
   removef -f $PKGINST || exit 2

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

   removef inherits the value of the following environment variable. This
   variable is set when [4]pkgadd(1M) or [5]pkgrm(1M) is invoked with the
   -R
   option.
   PKG_INSTALL_ROOT
   If present, defines the full path name of a directory to use as the
   system's PKG_INSTALL_ROOT path. All product and package information
   files are then looked for in the directory tree, starting with the
   specified PKG_INSTALL_ROOT path. If not present, the default system
   path of / is used.

EXIT STATUS

   0
   Successful completion.
   >0
   An error occurred.

NOTES

   Package commands are [18]largefile(5)-aware. They handle files larger
   than 2
   GB in the same way they handle smaller files. In their current
   implementations, [19]pkgadd(1M), [20]pkgtrans(1) and other package
   commands can
   process a datastream of up to 4 GB.
