NAME

   pkgchk - check package installation accuracy

SYNOPSIS

   pkgchk [-l | -acfnqvx] [-i file | -]
   [-p path... | -P partial-path...] [-R root_path]
   [ [-m pkgmap [-e envfile]] | pkginst... | -Y category,category...]
   pkgchk -d device [-l | -fv] [-i file | -] [-M] [-p path]...
   [-V fs_file]
   [pkginst... | -Y category[,category...]]

DESCRIPTION

   pkgchk checks the accuracy of installed files or, by using the -l
   option,
   displays information about package files. pkgchk checks the integrity
   of
   directory structures and files. Discrepancies are written to standard
   error along with a detailed explanation of the problem.
   The first synopsis defined above is used to list or check the contents
   and/or attributes of objects that are currently installed on the
   system,
   or in the indicated pkgmap. Package names may be listed on the command
   line, or by default, the entire contents of a machine will be checked.
   The second synopsis is used to list or check the contents of a package
   which has been spooled on the specified device, but not installed. Note
   that attributes cannot be checked for spooled packages.

OPTIONS

   The following options are supported:
   -a
   Audit the file attributes only and do not check file contents.
   Default is to check both.
   -c
   Audit the file contents only and do not check file attributes.
   Default is to check both.
   -d device
   Specify the device on which a spooled package resides. device can be
   a directory path name or the identifiers for tape, floppy disk, or
   removable disk (for example, /var/tmp or /dev/diskette).
   -e envfile
   Request that the package information file named as envfile be used to
   resolve parameters noted in the specified pkgmap file.
   -f
   Correct file attributes if possible. If used with the -x option, this
   option removes hidden files. When pkgchk is invoked with this option,
   it creates directories, named pipes, links, and special devices if
   they do not already exist. If the -d option calls out an uninstalled
   package, the -f option will only take effect if the package is in
   directory (not stream) format. All file attributes will be set to
   agree with the entries in the pkgmap file except that setuid, setgid,
   and sticky bits will not be set in the mode.
   -i file | -
   Read a list of path names from file or from stdin (-) and compare
   this list against the installation software database or the indicated
   pkgmap file. Path names that are not contained in file or stdin are
   not checked.
   -l
   List information on the selected files that make up a package. This
   option is not compatible with the -a, -c, -f, -g, and -v options.
   -m pkgmap
   Check the package against the package map file, pkgmap.
   -M
   Instruct pkgchk not to use the $root_path/etc/vfstab file for
   determining the client's mount points. This option assumes the mount
   points are correct on the server and it behaves consistently with
   Solaris 2.5 and earlier releases.
   -n
   Do not check volatile or editable files' contents. This should be
   used for most post-installation checking.
   -p path
   Check the accuracy only of the path name or path names listed. path
   can be one or more path names separated by commas (or by whitespace,
   if the list is quoted).
   To specify a path that includes a comma, you must use the -i option,
   described above. See EXAMPLES.
   -P partial-path
   Check the accuracy of only the partial path name or path names
   listed. partial-path can be one or more partial path names separated
   by commas (or by whitespace, if the list is quoted). This option can
   be used instead of -p and is not compatible with the other option.
   This option matches any path name that contains the string contained
   in the partial path. See the note about paths that contain commas in
   the description of -p.
   -q
   Quiet mode. Do not give messages about missing files.
   -R root_path
   Define the full name of a directory to use as the root_path. All
   files, including package system information files, are relocated to a
   directory tree starting in the specified root_path. The root_path may
   be specified when installing to a client from a server (for example,
   /export/root/client1).
   Note -
   The root file system of any non-global zones must not be referenced
   with the -R option. Doing so might damage the global zone's file
   system, might compromise the security of the global zone, and might
   damage the non-global zone's file system. See [1]zones(5).
   -v
   Verbose mode. Files are listed as processed.
   -V fs_file
   Specify an alternative fs_file to map the client's file systems. For
   example, used in situations where the $root_path/etc/vfstab file is
   non-existent or unreliable.
   -x
   Search exclusive directories, looking for files which exist that are
   not in the installation software database or the indicated pkgmap
   file.
   -Y category
   Check packages based on the value of the CATEGORY parameter stored in
   the installed or spooled package's [2]pkginfo(4) file.

OPERANDS

   pkginst
   The package instance or instances to be checked. The format pkginst.*
   can be used to check all instances of a package. The default is to
   display all information about all installed packages.
   The asterisk character (*) is a special character to some shells and
   may need to be escaped. In the C-Shell, an asterisk must be
   surrounded by single quotes (') or preceded by a backslash (\);
   partial-path
   A portion of a path, such as a file or directory name.

EXAMPLES

Example 1: Using pkgchk for Displaying Package Installation Information

   The following example displays package installation information for
   /usr/bin/ls:
   example% pkgchk -l -p /usr/bin/ls

Example 2: Checking on Java Font Properties

   The following example displays package installation information for all
   Java font properties installed on the system.
   example% pkgchk -l -P font.properties

Example 3: Specifying a Path That Contains a Comma

   Assume you want to specify the path:
   /platform/SUNW,Netra-T12/lib
   List this path in a file. Here is one way in which you can do that:
   example% echo "/platform/SUNW,Netra-T12/lib" > /tmp/p
   You can then enter:
   example% pkgchk -i /tmp/p -l
   Pathname: /platform/SUNW,Netra-T12/lib
   Type: directory
   Expected mode: 0755
   Expected owner: root
   Expected group: bin
   Referenced by the following packages:
   SUNWcar
   Current status: installed

EXIT STATUS

   0
   Successful completion.
   >0
   An error occurred.

NOTES

   Package commands are [11]largefile(5)-aware. They handle files larger
   than 2
   GB in the same way they handle smaller files. In their current
   implementations, [12]pkgadd(1M), [13]pkgtrans(1) and other package
   commands can
   process a datastream of up to 4 GB.
