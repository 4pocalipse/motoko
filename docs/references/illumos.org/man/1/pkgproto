   PKGPROTO(1) User Commands PKGPROTO(1)

NAME

   pkgproto - generate prototype file entries for input to pkgmk command

SYNOPSIS

   pkgproto [-i] [-c class] [path1]
   pkgproto [-i] [-c class] [path1=path2]...

DESCRIPTION

   pkgproto scans the indicated paths and generates [1]prototype(4) file
   entries that may be used as input to the [2]pkgmk(1) command.
   If no paths are specified on the command line, standard input is
   assumed
   to be a list of paths. If the pathname listed on the command line is a
   directory, the contents of the directory is searched. However, if input
   is read from stdin, a directory specified as a pathname will not be
   searched.
   Package commands, such as pkgproto, are [3]largefile(5)-aware. They
   handle
   files larger than 2 GB in the same way they handle smaller files. In
   their current implementations, [4]pkgadd(1M), [5]pkgtrans(1) and other
   package
   commands can process a datastream of up to 4 GB.

OPTIONS

   -i
   Ignores symbolic links and records the paths as ftype=f (a
   file) versus ftype=s (symbolic link).
   -c class
   Maps the class of all paths to class.

OPERANDS

   path1
   Pathname where objects are located.
   path2
   Pathname which should be substituted on output for path1.

EXAMPLES

Example 1: Basic Usage

   The following example shows a common usage of pkgproto and a partial
   listing of the output produced.
   example% pkgproto /bin=bin /usr/bin=usrbin /etc=etc
   f none bin/sed=/bin/sed 0775 bin bin
   f none bin/sh=/bin/sh 0755 bin daemon
   f none bin/sort=/bin/sort 0755 bin bin
   f none usrbin/sdb=/usr/bin/sdb 0775 bin bin
   f none usrbin/shl=/usr/bin/shl 4755 bin bin
   d none etc/master.d 0755 root daemon
   f none etc/master.d/kernel=/etc/master.d/kernel 0644 root daemon
   f none etc/rc=/etc/rc 0744 root daemon

Example 2: Using pkgproto in a Pipeline

   The following command shows pkgproto accepting the output of the find
   command.
   example% find / -type d -print | pkgproto
   d none / 755 root root
   d none /bin 755 bin bin
   d none /usr 755 root root
   d none /usr/bin 775 bin bin
   d none /etc 755 root root
   d none /tmp 777 root root

EXIT STATUS

   0
   Successful completion.
   >0
   An error occurred.

NOTES

   By default, pkgproto creates symbolic link entries for any symbolic
   link
   encountered (ftype=s). When you use the -i option, pkgproto creates a
   file entry for symbolic links (ftype=f). The [13]prototype(4) file
   would
   have to be edited to assign such file types as v (volatile), e
   (editable), or x (exclusive directory). pkgproto detects linked files.
   If multiple files are linked together, the first path encountered is
   considered the source of the link.
   By default, pkgproto prints prototype entries on the standard output.
   However, the output should be saved in a file (named Prototype or
   prototype, for convenience) to be used as input to the [14]pkgmk(1)
   command.
