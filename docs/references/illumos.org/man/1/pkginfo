NAME

   pkginfo - display software package information

SYNOPSIS

   pkginfo [-q | -x | -l] [-p | -i] [-r] [-a arch]
   [-v version] [-c category]... [pkginst]...
   pkginfo [-d device] [-R root_path] [-q | -x | -l] [-a arch]
   [-v version] [-c category]... [pkginst]...

DESCRIPTION

   pkginfo displays information about software packages that are installed
   on the system (with the first synopsis) or that reside on a particular
   device or directory (with the second synopsis).
   Without options, pkginfo lists the primary category, package instance,
   and the names of all completely installed and partially installed
   packages. It displays one line for each package selected.

OPTIONS

   The -p and -i options are meaningless if used in conjunction with the
   -d
   option.
   The options -q, -x, and -l are mutually exclusive.
   -a arch
   Specify the architecture of the package as arch.
   -c category
   Display packages that match category. Categories are defined with
   the CATEGORY parameter in the [1]pkginfo(4) file. If more than one
   category is supplied, the package needs to match only one category
   in the list. The match is not case specific.
   -d device
   Defines a device, device, on which the software resides. device can
   be an absolute directory pathname or the identifiers for tape, floppy
   disk, removable disk, and so forth. The special token spool may be
   used to indicate the default installation spool directory
   (/var/spool/pkg).
   -i
   Display information for fully installed packages only.
   -l
   Specify long format, which includes all available information about
   the designated package(s).
   -p
   Display information for partially installed packages only.
   -q
   Do not list any information. Used from a program to check whether or
   not a package has been installed.
   -r
   List the installation base for relocatable packages.
   -R root_path
   Defines the full path name of a directory to use as the root_path.
   All files, including package system information files, are relocated
   to a directory tree starting in the specified root_path.
   -v version
   Specify the version of the package as version. The version is defined
   with the VERSION parameter in the [2]pkginfo(4) file. All compatible
   versions can be requested by preceding the version name with a tilde
   (~). Multiple white spaces are replaced with a single white space
   during version comparison.
   -x
   Designate an extracted listing of package information. The listing
   contains the package abbreviation, package name, package architecture
   (if available) and package version (if available).

OPERANDS

   pkginst
   A package designation by its instance. An instance can be the package
   abbreviation or a specific instance (for example, inst.1 or inst.2).
   All instances of a package can be requested by inst.*. The asterisk
   character (*) is a special character to some shells and may need to
   be escaped. In the C-Shell, "*" must be surrounded by single quotes
   (') or preceded by a backslash (\).

EXIT STATUS

   0
   Successful completion.
   >0
   An error occurred.

FILES

   /var/spool/pkg
   default installation spool directory

NOTES

   Package commands are [11]largefile(5)-aware. They handle files larger
   than 2
   GB in the same way they handle smaller files. In their current
   implementations, [12]pkgadd(1M), [13]pkgtrans(1) and other package
   commands can
   process a datastream of up to 4 GB.
